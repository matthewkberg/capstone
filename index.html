                <p>
                    Minnesota lacks a Queer (LGBTQ+) community space where folks can come together to uplift Queer voices, encourage the art of making and nourish the collective spirit that comes from gathering.

                <p>
                    Working from an abundance mindset to continually imagine future ways of creating Queer spaces, I envision a multipurpose community center that would include a cafe, a bookshop, performance space, office space, and a production space for creating new media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be capable of hosting all types of events including open mic nights, community film screenings, support groups, and annual events like a Queer Prom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project began as a campaign to raise awareness for this missing need and along the way it has become focused on <a href="https://www.ourspacemn.com/">Our Space</a>, a Twin Cities based organization that has already begun the work of making this center a reality.

                    <p>
                        There is a need for a multipurpose Queer community space and I was determined to find out what obstacles are standing in the way of making this space a reality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In my initial research I learned that Minneapolis used to have a youth focused non-profit drop-in center called District 202. Established in 1992 as a coffee house with gallery and dance spaces, by 1997 it had moved into a larger space and was a thriving youth center which served 2,000 kids. This new location offered space to organize, an espresso bar, and a DJ booth and dance floor.

                        Unfortunately this physical space closed its doors in the summer of 2009 and its programs were absorbed by another local organization which delivered them online rather than in-person.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I wanted to learn more about how District 202 came into fruition and more importantly, what circumstances had led to this physical space disappearing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I was able to track down Elissa Raffa, who was part of the team that got District 202 off the ground, along with Michael Kaplan, the center's first Executive Director.
                    </p>

                        Michael shared how funding from The Minneapolis Foundation was integral to District 202's founding. They better understood the financial need required to launch such a venture and awarded them more funding than they had requested because they believe in the need for such a youth facility.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The kids District 202 served were predominantly POC, with a quarter of the kids navigating homelessness and exposure to street violence. It was difficult for white, middle class donors from the suburbs to feel comfortable with their children socializing with the other kids at the center.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I spoke with Elissa Raffa a little over a week after my conversation with Michael. Elissa had been involved in the formation of District 202 but was not a staff member once it was up and running. We spoke about her experience creating community space for young lesbians in the Twin Cities, as they often experienced being unwelcome at the Gay &#38 Lesbian youth groups that were being led out of area churches. District 202 was formed to be more inclusive.

                    <p>
                        In both meetings I was asked if I was in contact with Rox Anderson, a celebrated activist with over 20 years of social and civil service. Since 2018, Rox has been doing the work to bring a physical Queer community center back to the Twin Cities. They’ve held community conversations, engaging with over 200 folks to determine what a thriving Queer community center should be. I knew I needed to speak with them as soon as I was able.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While I was working to connect with Rox to schedule a time for us to meet I began working on how I would approach creating a solution to this missing need in our community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I kept thinking how surprised I was to learn about District 202 even though I grew up in the suburbs of Minneapolis while it was operating at its peak. How was I so unaware of this thriving center operating so close to me? How many others are similarly unaware of the work that Rox is doing?

                With my background in film and its ability to show more than just what it tells, I decided that I would focus on raising awareness with a motion graphics video campaign and supporting graphics for use in social media.

               I created a mood board for inspiration including a color palette that was closely related to Flip the Script’s brand colors since this idea started as a future space for our organization.

                In the months leading up to this project I had been working in Palm Springs, and was particularly drawn to mid century modern home illustration and how they floated in space amongst textured shapes. I was similarly drawn to a continuous line portrait I’d hastily drawn of a friend at a party.

                I began by using Procreate to draw some of the key imagined spaces that would exist inside the center and vectorized them in Illustrator. I also began sourcing stock illustrations that I could incorporate to be able to execute my idea within the time constraints.

                Lastly, I also wanted to explore an alternate version of my prototype video that used live action footage with animated illustrations. Since this was more of a test than a fully completed exploration, I focused on making a short style clip that could act as a guide for this potential future variation.

                After sharing my prototype video with my class, a few target users and a guest industry professional, I received these notes for refinement and changes.

                        Pacing is a bit slow; look for places to keep the tempo up.

                Around this same time I was able to meet with Rox Anderson and learn more about Our Space's focus on equity, sustainability, and community building. During this meeting I was granted permission to tailor my project specifically to Our Space going forward.

                I also learned that a District 202 reunion had recently been held in Minneapolis, at the pilot project space, QT Castle. Those in attendance were able to tour the space and learn about the mission and goals of Our Space. The bonds created at District 202 are still going strong and its community are eager target users for a new community center.

                With all of this in mind, I went to work in Illustrator to recreate the visual brand assets that appear on the Our Space website so that each shape could be animated individually in After Effects.

                I also drafted a new script that incorporates the story of Our Space, and its vision of what this thriving center should offer. While I had previously relied solely on text to tell the story, this time there was so much to share so I recorded a voiceover track. This allowed me to spend more time crafting scenes and key visuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was almost starting from scratch with this update and I took the advice to create storyboards this time to heart. Both my boards and making notes on the new script really helped me stay on track for such a major style change.

            <h2>Additional Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                I needed to get feedback from target users so I created a Google form that included my most recent Our Space prototype video along with the following questions:
            </p>

            <div class="quotes">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Which offered use is most important/exciting to you, and why?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What offerings and/or services do you want to see that are not currently mentioned?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Is it clear how you can get involved with Our Space?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        General thoughts and feedback?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                I shared this form with Elissa, Michael, and Rox, who shared it with other folks who are target users for Our Space, and in the end I received 23 individual responses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall the feedback was very positive and expressed a lot of excitement about the creation of a physical space that will serve in providing access to multiple services, programs, and social spaces simultaneously rather than being a single multipurpose space with rotating offerings.
            </p>
            <p>
                While most respondents thought it was clear how they could get involved with Our Space, there was also an interest in improving the segue into QT Castle and what role that space plays currently. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A user who identified as having a hearing impairment found the background music a little distracting, and there was also a suggestion to try a more exciting music track to match how exciting this future space is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, there was an interest in seeing a series of videos that built on this one to showcase the individual offerings and areas the space will contain. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From this collective feedback I revisited the VO script to better clarify how to get involved now and improve the description of what QT Castle is. I added on-screen text to highlight and reinforce what Our Space has to offer, and explored alternative music tracks.

                I also found that it was difficult for me to legibly read the Our Space logo when it was placed over the rainbow color palette so I decided to instead utilize a darker color set that was used in a majority of supporting graphics on the Our Space Website.

                Going forward my plan is to continue working with Our Space to create a new video that uses video footage and photographs of actual events and happenings that take place at QT Castle over the course of the Summer.
            </p>
            <p>
                My prototype will serve as a style guide for this, with the option to continue refining this illustration based version if there is a budget for licensing the stock images currently in use. If not, there is also the option to create original illustrations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also excited to tap into the desire for a series of short videos showcasing individual offerings in more detail and highlighting the multiple spaces the community will have access to.
