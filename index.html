                <p>
                    Minnesota lacks a Queer (LGBTQ+) community space where folks can come together to uplift Queer voices, encourage the art of making and nourish the collective spirit that comes from gathering.

                <p>
                    Working from an abundance mindset to continually imagine future ways of creating Queer spaces, I envision a multipurpose community center that would include a cafe, a bookshop, performance space, office space, and a production space for creating new media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be capable of hosting all types of events including open mic nights, community film screenings, support groups, and annual events like a Queer Prom.

                <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>
                        There is a need for a multipurpose Queer community space and I was determined to find out what obstacles are standing in the way of making this space a reality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In my initial research I learned that Minneapolis used to have a youth focused non-profit drop-in center called District 202. Established in 1992 as a coffee house with gallery and dance spaces, by 1996 it had evolved into a thriving youth center which served 2,000 kids.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="research-logo">

                        src="img/logos/District_202_logo.jpg"

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately this physical space closed its doors in the summer of 2009 and its programs were absorbed by another local organization which delivered them online rather than in-person.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I wanted to learn more about how District 202 came into fruition and more importantly, what circumstances had led to this physical space disappearing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I was able to track down Elissa Raffa, who was part of the team that got District 202 off the ground, along with Michael Kaplan, the center's first Executive Director.
                    </p>

                    <div class="headshot">

                    <p>
                        Michael shared how funding from The Minneapolis Foundation was integral to District 202's founding. They better understood the financial need required to launch such a venture and awarded them more funding than they had requested because they believe in the need for such a youth facility.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The kids District 202 served were predominantly POC, with a quarter of the kids navigating homelessness and exposure to street violence. It was difficult for white, middle class donors from the suburbs to feel comfortable with their children socializing with the other kids at the center.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Elissa had been involved in the formation of District 202 but was not a staff member once it was up and running. We spoke about her experience creating community space for young lesbians in the Twin Cities, as they often experienced being unwelcome at the Gay &#38 Lesbian youth groups that were being led out of area churches. District 202 was formed to be more inclusive.

                        In both meetings I learned that a District 202 reunion had recently been held in Minneapolis, by Rox Anderson, a celebrated activist with over 20 years of social and civil service. Rox has been doing the work to bring a physical Queer community center back to the Twin Cities, and I knew I needed to speak with them as soon as I was able.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                While I was working to connect with Rox to schedule a time for us to meet I began working on how I would approach creating a solution to this missing need in our community.
            </p>

            <p>
                I kept thinking how surprised I was to learn about District 202 even though I grew up in the suburbs of Minneapolis while it was operating at its peak. I also thought back to past meetings through my work at Flip the Script, a Queer film organization, and briefly hearing about Rox but I'd never been introduced.
            </p>

            <p>
                I decided that I would focus on raising awareness with a motion graphics video campaign and supporting graphics, such as gifs and shorter motion videos for use in social media.
            </p>

            <p>
                I began by using Procreate to draw some of the key imagined spaces that would exist inside the center and vectorized them in Illustrator. I also began sourcing stock illustrations that I could incorporate to be able to execute my idea within the time constraints.

                Around this same time I was able to meet with Rox Anderson and learn more about Our Space's focus on equity, sustainability, and community building. During this meeting I was granted permission to tailor my project specifically to Our Space going forward.

            <p>
                With all of this in mind, I went to work in Illustrator to recreate the visual brand assets that appear on the Our Space website so that each shape could be animated individually in After Effects. I also drafted a new script that incorporates the story of Our Space, and recorded it to use as a voiceover track.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was almost starting from scratch with this update and I took the advice to create storyboards this time to heart. Both my boards and making notes on the new script really helped me stay on track for such a major style change.

                I shared this form with Elissa Raffa, Michael Kaplan, and Rox Anderson, who shared it with other folks who are target users for Our Space, and in the end I received 23 individual responses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall the feedback was very positive and expressed a lot of excitement about the creation of a physical space that will serve in providing access to multiple services, programs, and social spaces simultaneously rather than being a single multipurpose space with rotating offerings.
            </p>

                While most respondents thought it was clear how they could get involved with Our Space, there was interest in improving the segue into QT Castle and what role that space plays currently. A user who identified as having a hearing impairment found the background music a little distracting, and there was also a suggestion to try a more exciting music track. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From this collective feedback I plan revisited the VO script to better clarify how to get involved now and improve the description of what QT Castle is. I will also added on-screen text to highlight and reinforce what Our Space has to offer.

                Going forward my plan is to continue working with Our Space to create a new video that uses video footage and photographs of actual events and happenings that take place at QT Castle over the course of the Summer.
            </p>
            <p>
                My prototype will serve as a style guide for this, with the option to continue refining this illustration based version if there is a budget for licensing the stock images currently in use. If not, there is also the option to create original illustrations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also excited to tap into the desire for a series of short videos showcasing individual offerings in more detail and highlighting the multiple spaces the community will have access to.
